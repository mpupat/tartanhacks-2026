# WinBack
### Team Bonjour Bombay submission for Tartanhacks 2026.

Winback is a smart financial solution that helps you invest your credit card cashback to win back extra money. Winback is backed by Kalshi to provide smart investing options and XRP Ledger blockchain to log all transactions for security and transparency. At the end of each month, you win all the money linked to your correct predictions. And since you are only reinvesting your cashback, in case of prediction errors, you don’t lose any money!
